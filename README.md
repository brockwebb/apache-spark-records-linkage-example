# apache-spark-records-linkage-example
Example of a records linkage using apache spark and databricks community edition

The R markdown file takes the raw data and transforms it for the Databricks part. A link to the public 
Databricks notebook does the rest.

It is simplistic, but demonstrates one of the benefits of being able to use Databricks and Spark 
using what you know already (in this case R) to be off and running, having data science fun.
