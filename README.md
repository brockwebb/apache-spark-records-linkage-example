# apache-spark-records-linkage-example
Example of a records linkage using apache spark and databricks community edition

The R markdown file takes the raw data and transforms it for the Databricks part. A link to the public 
Databricks notebook does the rest, and you can import it into your home.

In case the Databricks notebook goes away (think they only last 6 months), the PDF is a print of the code
and output.

It is simplistic, but demonstrates one of the benefits of being able to use Databricks and Spark 
using what you know already (in this case R) to be off and running, having data science fun.
